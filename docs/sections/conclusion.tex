\section{Conclusion}

We presented an optimization framework for energy flexibility prediction using six strategies targeting class imbalance, feature redundancy, and model robustness. Testing shows clear gains: minority class detection improves 15-25\%, sparse region RMSE drops 10-15\%, and ensembles boost overall performance 2-5\%.

The cascade classifier reaches 50-52\% geometric mean, best balancing performance across event types. Ensembles achieve top overall accuracy with fast inference. Feature selection cuts training time 2-3$\times$ while improving generalization.

Results across three buildings show the methods work despite different characteristics, class distributions, and patterns. The modular design lets practitioners pick optimizations based on their resources and needs.

Future work includes adaptive optimization selection, transfer learning across sites, and online learning for real-time updates.
