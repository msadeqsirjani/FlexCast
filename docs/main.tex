\begin{abstract}
Energy flexibility prediction faces three key challenges: severe class imbalance with events occurring less than 0.1\% of the time, high-dimensional redundant features, and the need for both classification and regression. This work presents an optimization framework combining feature selection, class weighting, synthetic oversampling, ensemble methods, and cascade classifiers. Testing across three commercial buildings shows minority class F1-scores improve by 15-25\%, sparse region RMSE drops by 10-15\%, and ensembles gain 2-5\% overall. The cascade classifier reaches 50-52\% geometric mean, better balancing performance across rare events than direct multi-class methods. Each optimization can be applied independently based on computational constraints.
